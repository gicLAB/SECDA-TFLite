# SECDA-TFLite: A Toolkit for Efficient Development of FPGA-based DNN Accelerators for Edge Inference

The SECDA-TFLite toolkit leverages the TFLite delegate system to provide a robust and extensible set of utilities for integrating DNN accelerators for any DNN operation supported by TFLite.
Ultimately, this increases hardware accelerator developers' productivity, as they can begin developing and refining their design more quickly.
